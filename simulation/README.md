TODO: example usage will be provided soon

This directory contains codes that can be used for geometric and wave acoustic simulations. You may replace them with any other simulators of the same type as long as the same input is parsed correctly by both simulators, though energy calibration should be done for any new combinations.

## Wave Acoustic Simulation
This part relies on the [pffdtd](https://github.com/bsxfun/pffdtd) software. A forked and modified version is provided in this folder which has a few more features that are helpful for large scale simulations. 

## Geometric Acoustic Simulation
This part relies on the [pygsound](https://github.com/GAMMA-UMD/pygsound) software.
