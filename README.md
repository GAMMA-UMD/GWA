# GWA
Geometric-Wave Acoustic dataset

## Download
See [download](download/README.md) for more details.

## Usage
The pre-computed IRs are provided as is and mostly used by convolving them with dry sounds to create artificial reverberation. We will provide more details and codes in this repo (in May 2022) on how to run the data generation pipeline using general 3D datasets with proper material assignments.
